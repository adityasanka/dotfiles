# You can run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a
# list of all available config options and their default values.
#
# See also: `man ghostty`

# Syntax
# ---
#
# Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# a comment after a config option, it will be interpreted as a part
# of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc #
#
# Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
#
# All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value  
# key =value
# key = value
#
#
# Empty values are used to reset config keys to default
# key = 
#
#
# Some config options have unique syntax for their value,
# which is explained in the docs for that config option.
