My primary font is **Maple Mono Nerd Font**, a versatile and visually appealing font optimized for programming and terminal use.

## Installation

To install the font on MacOS, run the following command:

```bash
brew install font-maple-mono-nf
```

## Why Maple Mono?

Maple Mono is an excellent choice for developers due to the following features:

**Open Source**

Maple Mono is an open-source font, making it free to use, share, and customize.

**Nerd Font Integration**

Includes a wide range of glyphs and icons commonly used in terminal tools and coding environments, such as Starship, Oh-My-Zsh, and Powerline.

**Clear, Readable, and Quirky**

The font strikes a perfect balance between clarity and a touch of quirkiness, making it not only practical but also fun to read.
